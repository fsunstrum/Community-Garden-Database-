# Project Summary
This database management system will be used by a municipality to store information about various community gardens throughout the city so that they can better organize these community gardens. Each garden will be managed by different community organizations and they will record the plants that are seeded in each plot and the gardeners who are assigned to each plot. There will also be donations of tools and plants which are recorded so that the garden members will know what is available for use.
